# Tech Debt Tracker

## Goal

Track deferred cross-cutting debt, unresolved architecture choices, and post-phase work.

## Scope

- Deferred implementation items not in current phase scope.
- Future architecture evolution items that should not block Phase 2 delivery.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add CI workflows for lint/typecheck/tests/e2e (explicitly deferred in Phase 2).
- [x] Add Go OTLP ingest integration coverage (gRPC ingest path baseline exists).
- [x] Add Python and TypeScript/JavaScript OTLP ingest integration coverage.
- [x] Add integration tests for ingest forwarding to Tempo.
- [ ] Add benchmark and payload-size guardrail tests.
- [x] Expand SDK end-to-end examples for Python and TypeScript/JavaScript.
- [ ] Define retention and pruning policies for hot MySQL payloads vs compacted object storage.
- [x] Define ingestion-log abstraction interface and implementation migration plan.
- [ ] Evaluate Kafka as next backend for ingestion-log abstraction.
- [ ] Evaluate WarpStream as a lower-ops-cost Kafka-compatible backend option.
- [ ] Add automated model-card catalog refresh tooling (external source + static fallback).

## Risks

- Deferred CI keeps regression detection local-only.
- Delay on ingestion-log abstraction can increase MySQL-specific coupling.
- Deferred benchmark work can hide scale bottlenecks until later phases.

## Exit Criteria

- Deferred items are either completed or moved into scoped active execution plans.
- Open architecture decisions have written outcomes linked from design docs.
- Reliability and CI guardrails exist for critical ingest/query/proxy paths.
